# Build Locally Rules

## Always Build Locally First

- Always run `npm run build` locally before pushing changes
- Fix all TypeScript and ESLint errors locally before committing
- Ensure the build passes successfully before pushing to avoid Vercel deployment failures

## Code Quality Standards

- Use proper TypeScript types instead of `any`
- Prefix unused parameters with `_` to avoid ESLint warnings
- Ensure all API endpoints have proper error handling
- Test API endpoints locally before deployment

## Database Schema

- Ensure all database tables exist before using them in API calls
- Use proper error handling for database operations
- Include detailed error messages for debugging

## Script Validation

- Always check scripts after editing to ensure they work correctly
- Verify that edited scripts don't have syntax errors or broken functionality
- Test scripts locally before considering them complete
- Never leave scripts in a broken state - fix errors immediately
